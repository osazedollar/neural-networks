# Neural Network Example

This project demonstrates a simple neural network implementation in Python using NumPy. The neural network is a single-layer perceptron model designed to learn from a small dataset. The model is trained using a basic backpropagation algorithm with a sigmoid activation function.

## Features

- A single neuron model with three input connections and one output connection.
- Uses a sigmoid activation function to normalize outputs between 0 and 1.
- Trains through iterative adjustments of synaptic weights using a simple learning rule.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.
