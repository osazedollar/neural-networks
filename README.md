# Neural Network

This project demonstrates a simple neural network implementation in Python using NumPy. The neural network is a single-layer perceptron model designed to learn from a small dataset. The model is trained using a basic backpropagation algorithm with a sigmoid activation function.

## Features

- A single neuron model with three input connections and one output connection.
- Uses a sigmoid activation function to normalize outputs between 0 and 1.
- Trains through iterative adjustments of synaptic weights using a simple learning rule.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://osazedollar/neural-networks.git
    cd neural-network-example
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

### Running the Project

To run the neural network example:

```bash
python app.js
```

The output will display the randomly initialized synaptic weights, the new weights after training, and the neural network's prediction for a test input.

## Example Output

```
Random starting synaptic weights:
[[-0.16595599]
 [ 0.44064899]
 [-0.99977125]]

New synaptic weights after training:
[[ 9.67299303]
 [-0.2078435 ]
 [-4.62963669]]

Considering new situation [1, 0, 0] -> ?:
[0.99993704]
```

## Code Overview

- **`neural_network.py`**: Contains the `NeuralNetwork` class with methods for initializing, training, and thinking (making predictions).
  - `__init__`: Initializes the synaptic weights.
  - `__sigmoid`: Applies the sigmoid function to normalize inputs.
  - `__sigmoid_derivative`: Calculates the derivative of the sigmoid function.
  - `train`: Adjusts synaptic weights based on training data using a simple learning rule.
  - `think`: Uses the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The network starts with random weights.
2. **Training**: The model adjusts its weights over multiple iterations using the training data provided.
3. **Prediction**: After training, the model can predict outputs for new inputs based on the learned weights.
