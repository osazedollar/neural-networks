# Neural Network Web Interface

This project provides a simple web interface to interact with a neural network model. Users can input data to receive predictions from the trained neural network.

## Features
- A web form to input data for predictions.
- Internal styling for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Display of predictions based on input data using a neural network model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NumPy

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/osazedollar/neural-networks.git
    cd neural-network-web-interface
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Access the web interface:**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. Enter the input data as comma-separated values (e.g., `1,0,0`).
2. Click the "Predict" button to get the prediction from the neural network.
3. The prediction result will be displayed on the page.

## File Structure

- `app.py` - Main Flask application file that sets up the web server and routes.
- `neural_network.py` - Contains the neural network implementation and prediction logic.
- `templates/` - Directory containing HTML templates for rendering the web interface.
- `static/` - Directory for static files like CSS (if applicable).
- `README.md` - This file, which provides an overview and setup instructions for the project.

## Example Input and Output

**Example Input:** `1,0,0`

**Expected Output:** The neural network will output a prediction based on the input values.
